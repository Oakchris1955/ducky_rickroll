# BadUSB rickroll
## What is this?
This is pretty much a script to rickroll someone using a BadUSB - also known as a Ducky
## What do I need?
A device that can run Duckyscript payloads
## Where is the script?
The file `payload.dd` contains the script, that's what you must use. Althought, in order to work, the PC must have an internet connection
## I don't have a Ducky / I don't have enough money to buy one
Then use a Raspberry Pico. It is quite cheap, around 5 bucks, and can be easily configured to run Ducky scripts. Check [this](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) repository for more info
