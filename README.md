# Pico Ducky Rickroll
Rickroll someone with just a Raspberry Pico
## What does it do?
It makes you have the ability of rickrolling someone just by plugging a Raspberry Pico on their PC
## Requirements
Raspberry Pi Pico, USB cable, a PC
Also a jumper wire (unless you wanna get rickrolled)
## Installation 
1) Install the required software in your Pico as described here: https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky
2) Connect the GPIO 0 of the Pico to a Ground (unless you wanna get rickrolled)
3) Download `payload.dd` and place it on the main directory of your Pico
4) Unplug the Pico and place it on a computer to make sure it work
## Should I use it?
Although you can use it, I am planning on making a better version of it where you can select the video to play, the time to play, etc. Still, if all you want is rickroll someone, go ahead and use it
